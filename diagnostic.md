```

handlebars?

the handlebars templating library. It is handlebars.
```

```sh

component.
```

How does a component differ from an Ember template?

```sh
the template is what is generated with ember.
The component is a particular part of a route.

```

What is an opinionated framework? Is Ember opinionated? How or how not?

```sh
A framework may be useful but isn''t necessary to completion of something as
there are other ways to accomplish a common goal it accomplishes.
Ember is opinionated in that it is still in relatively early development phases
and yet is widespread in use.
```

In Ember what is a route's job (please list three)?

```sh
directs for where to go to and
has a router to say that direction.
has a routes handler.
has a template that can be changed if needed.
```
