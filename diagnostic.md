# Ember Diagnostic

What are three advantages of using Ember?

```sh
Routability
Less AJAX
Responsiveness - The front end does not need to make as many requests to the back
end for data it needs
```

What is the templating system used in Ember? How it is related to
handlebars?

```sh
The templating system is a way of setting the HTML content in the route or component.
It works by writing handlebars to access different routes or components. Templates can
also reference different components by name
```

Name and describe at least two layers of an Ember application:

```sh
Routes and Models
```

How does a component differ from an Ember template?

```sh
A component does not have access to the entire route, instead its scope is defined at
the location where the Component is invoked. Making it very re-usable
```

What is an opinionated framework? Is Ember opinionated? How or how not?

```sh
An opinionated framework is a framework that forces you to write and do things in its
own way. Ember is very opinionated simply for the reason that if you do not follow
the strict guidelines it has, many things of your code will not work. For example, using
either kebab-case or camel-case for naming files.
```

In Ember what is a route's job (please list three)?

```sh
# your answer here
```
