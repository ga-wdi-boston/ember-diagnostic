Name and describe at least two layers of an Ember application:

```sh
1. Route: the path in the app that leads to a certain destination (these are also
   urls)

   on the front-end.
```

their own tags for their own purposes.
```

What is an opinionated framework? Is Ember opinionated? How or how not?

Ember is opinionated because the there are many ember guides online and they
explain in great detail what to do at every step.
```
