# Ember Diagnostic

What are three advantages of using Ember?

```sh
It is easy to manage views
Do not need AJAX for hide/show
It is highly organized
```

What is the templating system used in Ember? How it is related to
handlebars?

```sh
You create templates of HTML which reference the models to interpolate specific data.  It is like handlebars because both use interpolate dynamic data into HTML
```

Name and describe at least two layers of an Ember application:

```sh
Models hold the data, for example a list of employees with name and job type.
Templates incorporate that data by interpolating into HTML
```

How does a component differ from an Ember template?

```sh
A component is a piece of the template (designated by '{{ }}') that takes data from the model and interpolates it into the template.
```

What is an opinionated framework? Is Ember opinionated? How or how not?

```sh
An opinionated framework means that there is a specific best practice that the framework wants all developers to follow.  Ember is opinionated because it wants you to use all the different layers to separate your concerns.
```

In Ember what is a route's job (please list three)?

```sh
A route holds data and exports specific pieces of that data, to be used by the template.
```
