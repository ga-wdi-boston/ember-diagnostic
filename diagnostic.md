# Ember Diagnostic

What are three advantages of using Ember?

```sh
The speed of navigating between the content is fast.  It lets you bind data, keeping track of changes across multiple layers.   Ember is highly opinionated which saves time and headaches.
```

What is the templating system used in Ember?

```sh
Handlebars
```

When we code we'll typically start with the Ember Template, but Ember has a
project generator, what is the command to generate a new ember application?

```sh
ember new <my-new-app>
```

Name at least two parts of an Ember application (1.0 or 2.0):

```sh
A controller and a template.
```

How does a component differ from an Ember template?

```sh
A component is made up of a template and a javascript file.
```

Is Ember opinionated?

```sh
Yes, which makes it easier for people who don't know what they're doing.
```

In Ember what is a route's job (please list three)?

```sh
When the URL changes, the route redirects to the new URL if it can, calls the appropriate model and loads that models data into a specific template.
```
