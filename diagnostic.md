# Ember Diagnostic

What are three advantages of using Ember?

```md
A routing system that allows for a single page application allowing for
  back functionality and boomarking
Less AJAX
More use of the cache because of less AJAX, yielding more responsiveness
```

What is the templating system used in Ember? How it is related to
handlebars?

```md
Each template is written in Handlebars. The template is the HTML content that
corresponds to the route.
```

Name and describe at least two layers of an Ember application:

```md
Routes
Templates
Models
```

How does a component differ from an Ember template?

```md
Still kind of confused about this. Components come from the template and don't
have full access to the route. They are smaller pieces of code and thus, more
modular.
```

What is an opinionated framework? Is Ember opinionated? How or how not?

```md
An opinionated framework is one in which the person using the framework
*has* to use the guidelines setup by the creator of the framework. Ember is
opinionanted because it relies heavily on its own conventions. If using Ember
and straying from conventions, it could result in someone not being able to read
your code or Ember not working entirely.
```

In Ember what is a route's job (please list three)?

```md
Takes you to the desired view state
Renders the desired HTML
It can route somewhere else
```
