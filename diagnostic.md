# Ember Diagnostic

What are three advantages of using Ember?

```sh
Ember caches data on the front end, binds data so that updates can be made to the database and the front end at the same time and has routes on the front end which makes navigating from one area view-state to another very quick.
```

What is the templating system used in Ember? How it is related to
handlebars?

```sh
Ember uses HTMLBar which is a version of handlebars with additional functionality.
```

Name and describe at least two layers of an Ember application:

```sh
Router, Routes, Components, Adapter, Model, Templates.
```

How does a component differ from an Ember template?

```sh
A component has two parts a template file and a component file. The template is more modular and can be used for various data sets, where the regular Ember template is specialized for one data set. The component file handles functionality.
```

What is an opinionated framework? Is Ember opinionated? How or how not?

```sh
Ember is opinionated. Filenames, filepathes, folders and locations of different aspects of the application are well defined in the documentation because an application that does not follow them will not work. Developers using Ember cannot customize their application structure as much as 'if' they were using a less opionated framework.
```

In Ember what is a route's job (please list three)?

```sh
- parse info in URL
- links to a template
- loads data w/model method
        - may make HTTP request

Used class notes, wikipedia and Ember documentation to answer questions.
