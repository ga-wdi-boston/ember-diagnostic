What are three advantages of using Ember?

```sh
1. Data binding to synchronize changes across models, objects and views.
2. The Ember CLI which has a list of tools for developers to build their app
quickly.
3. The use of URLs and its use of convention over configuration.
```

What is the templating system used in Ember?

```sh
Embers templating system is handlebars.
```

When we code we'll typically start with the Ember Template, but Ember has a
project generator, what is the command to generate a new ember application?

```sh
ember new <name of project>
```

Name at least two parts of an Ember application (1.0 or 2.0):

```sh
Components and Models
```

How does a component differ from an Ember template?

```sh
You could define your own, application-specific HTML tags, then implement their behavior using JavaScript.
An ember template is limited by the tags set by the W3C.
```

Is Ember opinionated?

```sh
Yes, it forces developers to put into use Embers best practices.
```

In Ember what is a route's job (please list three)?

```sh
It renders a template, loads a model that renders the template, it can handle actions
that change a model or transition to a new route.
```
