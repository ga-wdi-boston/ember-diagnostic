# Ember Diagnostic

What are three advantages of using Ember?

```sh
Adding routes to SPAs.
Adding views to SPAs.
Dynamic update of page content.
```

What is the templating system used in Ember? How it is related to
handlebars?

```sh
The templating system in Ember is pretty much just handlebars. They were quite possibly worked on by the same person.
```

Name at least two layers of an Ember application (1.0 or 2.0):

```sh
Route layer, view layer, model layer, controller layer.
```

How does a component differ from an Ember template?

```sh
You cannot route to an Ember component, but you can create a route to a template.
```

What is an opinionated framework? Is Ember opinionated? How or how not?

```sh
An opinionated framework cares about not only what you name files and variables, but also how you name them. Ember is a very opinionated framework, stipulating that views must be in individual folders, those view have a template file for view content and a route file, that file names are kabab cased, etc...
```

In Ember what is a route's job (please list three)?

```sh
A route's job is to parse a URL and display a view based on that URL's content. This allows views in an Ember SPA to be shared, bookmarked, forked, basically anything you could do with a multi-page website.
```
