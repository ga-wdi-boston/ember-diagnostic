# Ember Diagnostic

What are three advantages of using Ember?

```md
It unbreaks the web by associating application state and urls. It has opinions, which is very helpful for younger developers. It's responsive (not in the 'my interface scales with viewport size' way).
```

What is the templating system used in Ember?

```md
HTMLBars
```

When we code we'll typically start with the Ember Template, but Ember has a
project generator, what is the command to generate a new ember application?

```sh
ember new application-name-here
```

Name at least two parts of an Ember application (1.0 or 2.0):

```md
The router, models, controllers, templates
```

How does a component differ from an Ember template?

```md
Components are custom, application-specific HTML tags. Templates contain static HTML and dynamic content inside Handlebars expressions; they render the data on the page.
```

Is Ember opinionated?

```md
Yes, Ember has opinions. It is great; like Rails.
```

In Ember what is a route's job (please list three)?

```md
Displaying templates, loading data, and setting up application state.
```
