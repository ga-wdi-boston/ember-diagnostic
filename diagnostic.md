# Ember Diagnostic

What are three advantages of using Ember?

```sh
Its an optinionated framework, so a lot of decisions are already made.
It has ember cli, which has a lot of built in developer tools.
Ember data can do crud actions easily and interacts well with db\'s
```

What is the templating system used in Ember?

```sh
Handlebars
```

When we code we'll typically start with the Ember Template, but Ember has a
project generator, what is the command to generate a new ember application?

```sh
ember new <app-name>
```

Name at least two parts of an Ember application (1.0 or 2.0):

```sh
router
components
```

How does a component differ from an Ember template?

```sh
a template is html rendered via handlebars. A component is html rendered with data from the model
```

Is Ember opinionated?

```sh
Yes
```

In Ember what is a route's job (please list three)?

```sh
The route tells the router to load the view-state, load the data for the view-state, and connects to the browser\'s history so as to not break the internet.
```
