# Ember Diagnostic

What are three advantages of using Ember?

```sh
Separation of concerns
Simplifying code required for UI functionality
Ease of formatting (sass)
```

What is the templating system used in Ember? How it is related to
handlebars?

```sh
Handlebars templates are used for each piece of information the user sees
```

Name and describe at least two layers of an Ember application:

```sh
View layer - the layer the user sees
Data - the layer that stores info
```

How does a component differ from an Ember template?

```sh
A template is the way some information is displayed.
A component is defining the information that will be displayed.
```

What is an opinionated framework? Is Ember opinionated? How or how not?

```sh
Has a set of built in guidelines and procedures for building an application.
Ember seems to be pretty opinionated, and my linter seems to be even more opinionated about its use of semi-colons.
```

In Ember what is a route's job (please list three)?

```sh
Setting points for a url
Defining where different pieces of information can be accessed within the ui
Invoking the model method for that route (I think I am phrasing that right)
```
