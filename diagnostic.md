What are three advantages of using Ember?

```sh
1\. no needt o write AJAX.
2\. you can navigate to different 'componants' in youe website without the need to
different pages.
3\. the front end save a lot of data in local host so it loads the page faster
and , it doesnt need to wait until its synched up with the back-end before
showing the updated data.
```

What is the templating system used in Ember? How it is related to handlebars?

```sh
templating in ember is like nre pages in a non spa website.
it similer to handle bar because it let you render different views on one page.
and you write handlebars inside of ember templates.

```

Name and describe at least two layers of an Ember application:

```sh
Template
--------
Raw HTML, this is where you write your code to display anything on the screen.


 Route ? ( I am not sure if thats what u meant )
 -------
Routes let you direct the url of the templates to have different 'pages' on the website.
it loads the model and link thed template to router.
 
```

How does a component differ from an Ember template?

```sh
I think that component can be used on templates and it does not have
access to the entire scope of the Route.
```

What is an opinionated framework? Is Ember opinionated? How or how not?

```sh
An opinionated framework is if a framework is opinionated,
it lock or guides you into their way of doing things.

I believe that ember is an opinionated framework it only allows access to data structures.
By design, the software is limiting and encourages the designer into doing things their way.

```

In Ember what is a routes job (please list three)?

```sh
1. parsing information contained in the URL, such as an ID or a query string
2. linking the Router to a particular Component/Template (among other things)
3. loading the UI elements data via a method called model
```
