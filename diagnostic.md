# Ember Diagnostic

What are three advantages of using Ember?

```sh
# It provides a ton of structure and best practices to the front end via is framework and the built in handle bars. It gives a ton of ways to shorten up things
# that would take much longer to write such as making ajax style calls with out even writing any ajax. It makes code just plan easier to read through the structure it provides and the breifness and clarity of its code.
```

What is the templating system used in Ember? How it is related to
handlebars?

```sh
# Ember uses the handlebars template library to structure its front end framwork
#  so essentially it is just integrating handlebars into itself?
```
<!-- I am not sure if that is completely accurate however I know we use handlebars in ember as we structured yesterdays pieces.  -->

Name and describe at least two layers of an Ember application:

```sh
# Well it structures itself very similar to ruby in how it creates an object model and how it does its routing. This in turn makes structuring data on the frontend a lot easier and negates the need for ajax calls. It also allows for the creation of frontend routing.
```

How does a component differ from an Ember template?

```sh
# A component seems to me to be very similar to an object. My interpretation is that it is the object that is being modeled or used in a template.
```
<!-- I again and not 100% clear here if that is what it actually is, thats just my interpretation of it. -->
What is an opinionated framework? Is Ember opinionated? How or how not?

```sh
# It is an opinionated framework because it has strict guide lines in how it wants you to write and structure your code. This is turn makes it much easier for someone else to read and understand. It creates an expectation of how your code should look.
```

In Ember what is a route's job (please list three)?

```sh
# It sets what content the user will see. It defines what must be added to the url to see that content. And connects the the data to be provided to the frontend from the back end, by knowing where to access it.
```
<!--  I am not sure if there was a specific list you were looking for here, but from my understanding of a router in ember it basically is directing traffic and defining routes to data? -->
