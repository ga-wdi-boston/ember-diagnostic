What are three advantages of using Ember?

```md

What is the templating system used in Ember? How it is related to
handlebars?

```md
They use handlebars within their view framework. That is to say, each view has its own template which may be compiled along with many componants which in turn may have their own templates. These templates are all pumped into a basic ember html boilerplate and may also have extensions with in their HB templates.
```

Name at least two layers of an Ember application (1.0 or 2.0):

```md
View layer
Routes layer
```

How does a component differ from an Ember template?

```md
componants are like little snippits of code which can have their own compartmentalized javascipt. They can be used within templates but cant be routed to like templates
```

What is an opinionated framework? Is Ember opinionated? How or how not?

```md
It means the language is very particular about layout and semantics. From what I gather ember is very opinionated.

```

In Ember what is a route's job (please list three)?

```md
To point to the right view
To isolate the content being viewed/utilized
To make make URLs useful
```
