# Ember Diagnostic

What are three advantages of using Ember?

```sh
- Ember provides a complete solution when it comes to a client side app.
- The app runs within the users browser and is self contained, including everything it needs.
- Ember is meant to be completely backward compatible so that past, or even outdated, innovations
  are maintained.
```

What is the templating system used in Ember? How it is related to
handlebars?

```sh
Ember uses Handlebars.  Handlebars is a templating engine that is also
maintained by the Emberteam

```

Name and describe at least two layers of an Ember application:

```sh
- Ember-Data is ember’s storage layer.
- The Ember’s Views layer manages the rendering of views that connect to the browsers DOM
```

How does a component differ from an Ember template?

```sh
An Ember component consists of a Handlebars template file and an accompanying Ember class.
The implementation of this class is required only when we need extra interactivity with
the component. A component is used like ordinary HTML tag.
```

What is an opinionated framework? Is Ember opinionated? How or how not?

```sh
An opinionated framework can be  limiting and encourages the designer to do things their way.
Ember is considered a very opinionated framework which forces you to structure your app the way
it wants you to.
```

In Ember what is a route's job (please list three)?

```sh
Routes display the appropriate model depending on the hook. This is then handed over to the component
for display
```
