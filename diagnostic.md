# Ember Diagnostic

What are three advantages of using Ember?

```sh
1) Fast
2) Can have "back" button / bookmark, better ui overall.
3) Data-binding
```

What is the templating system used in Ember? How it is related to
handlebars?

```sh
Handlebars...unless I am reading wrong...but you can add some more stuff. (I.e. components)
```

Name at least two layers of an Ember application (1.0 or 2.0):

```sh
Model, Router, Template
```

How does a component differ from an Ember template?

```sh
A component is reusable code. Template is specific to the route.
```

What is an opinionated framework? Is Ember opinionated? How or how not?

```sh
Opinionated framework is one that has very rigid / defined syntac. Ember is very opinionated. For example, the kebab-case vs camelCase specificities make Ember opinionated.
```

In Ember what is a route's job (please list three)?

```sh
1) Loading the appropriate model.
2) Determining appropriate template to use.
3) Displaying the template? Not 100% sure on this 3rd one...
```
