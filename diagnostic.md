# Ember Diagnostic

What are three advantages of using Ember?

```sh
Stability
Built-in Best Practices
Ember inspector!
```

What is the templating system used in Ember? How it is related to
handlebars?

```sh
It is used within a templates folder and allows for separation of concerns by splitting parts of views into seperate files/folders.
It IS handlebars (.hbs)
```

Name and describe at least two layers of an Ember application:

```sh
Router - based on the URL the router maps it to 1+ handlers
Component - is a view that is totally isolated
```

How does a component differ from an Ember template?

```sh
Components are isolated and do not rely on other things. Components have two things: a Javascript component file that defines behavior, and its Handlebars template.
```

What is an opinionated framework? Is Ember opinionated? How or how not?

```sh
An opinionated framework makes assumptions about best practices and the app architechture.
It is very opinionated - it makes you organize your app a certain way.
```

In Ember what is a route's job (please list three)?

```sh
Render a template
Load a model which is then available to the template
Redirect to a new route e.g. if the user does not have permissions for something
```
