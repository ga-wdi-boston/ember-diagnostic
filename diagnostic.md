# Ember Diagnostic

What are three advantages of using Ember?

```sh
Increased developer productivity since it is opinionated and prevents time being wasted on which way to structure the project.

It has a strong CLI interface that saves developers from having to do things like set up build tools or organize code into modules.  

It is easier for developers to understand pre existing code bases for new projects than in other languages.
```

What is the templating system used in Ember?

```sh
The HTMLBars handlebars templating library, a variation of Handlebars that builds DOM elements instead of a string.
```

When we code we'll typically start with the Ember Template, but Ember has a
project generator, what is the command to generate a new ember application?

```sh
ember new <app-name>
```

Name at least two parts of an Ember application (1.0 or 2.0):

```sh
Routers, models.
```

How does a component differ from an Ember template?

```sh
Templates build the app's HTML whereas components are custom HTML tags that are built on JavaScript and then shown using templates.
```

Is Ember opinionated?

```sh
Yes but it's opinion isn't entirely inflexible; it can be a starting point that you can change.
```

In Ember what is a route's job (please list three)?

```sh
To represent each URL in the app, to refer to and load the view state (changes in a route changes what you see in the app), and to load the associated model and data associated with that model.
```
