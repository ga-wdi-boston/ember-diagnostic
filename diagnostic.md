# Ember Diagnostic

What are three advantages of using Ember?

```sh
Routability (back button, bookmarking, etc. work)
Less AJAX (Ember handles the AJAX behind the scenes)
Responsiveness (data displays much faster).
```

What is the templating system used in Ember?

```sh
Handlebars
```

When we code we'll typically start with the Ember Template, but Ember has a
project generator, what is the command to generate a new ember application?

```sh
ember new
```

Name at least two parts of an Ember application (1.0 or 2.0):

```sh
Views
Templates
```

How does a component differ from an Ember template?

```sh
Component is a feature of Ember 2. The component will replace controllers and views in Ember 3. Like views, components have templates associate with them. A component can be invoked from within a template, but is not the template itself.
```

Is Ember opinionated?

```sh
Yes.
```

In Ember what is a route's job (please list three)?

```sh
* Parsing information contained in the URL
* Linking the Router to a particular view/template
* Loading the data for the particular UI element via a method called model
```
