# Ember Diagnostic

What are three advantages of using Ember?

```sh
# Without any configuration, Ember Data can load and save records and
# relationships served via a RESTful JSON API, provided it follows certain
# conventions. It takes out so much of the grunt work with all it's opinions,
# allowing you to focus on your app, It's easy to change and scale for
# ambitious applications. It has CLI tools that give you a lot more control.
```

What is the templating system used in Ember?

```sh
# Handlebars
```

When we code we'll typically start with the Ember Template, but Ember has a
project generator, what is the command to generate a new ember application?

```sh
# ember new applicationname
```

Name at least two parts of an Ember application (1.0 or 2.0):

```sh
# Routes Models Templates
```

How does a component differ from an Ember template?

```sh
# The component is a sort of handler for the routing, the data populated by models into templates
```

Is Ember opinionated?

```sh
# Yes. It establishes a bunch of idiomatic predefined settings to make your job easier, so instead of reinventing the wheel constantly you can just focus on what has been established to work well and make the changes specific to your app
```

In Ember what is a route's job (please list three)?

```sh
# collects data
# renders templates
# communicating between the models and templates
# handle all routing actions such as transitioning to a new route or changing
# models
```
