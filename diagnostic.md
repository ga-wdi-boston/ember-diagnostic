# Ember Diagnostic

What are three advantages of using Ember?

```sh
It does much of the tedious and difficult parts of front-end web application development for you, so you can focus on writing the actual app. It does this without "breaking the web"--that is, it ties URLs to app states so that users can use their browser as it was meant to be used. And it is "opinionated", which is arguably a benefit because it encourages best practices and adherence to the principle of least surprise.
```

What is the templating system used in Ember?

```sh
Ember uses HTMLbars, which is an extended version of handlebars, to load HTML onto the page dynamically in response to user input.
```

When we code we'll typically start with the Ember Template, but Ember has a
project generator, what is the command to generate a new ember application?

```sh
ember generate project_name
```

Name at least two parts of an Ember application (1.0 or 2.0):

```sh
Routes and components.
```

How does a component differ from an Ember template?

```sh
Components have both a JS and an HTMLbars portion, and function basically as custom HTML tags with behavior that you define. They are reusable bits of code that can be placed inside components as needed.
```

Is Ember opinionated?

```sh
Yes, very much so.
```

In Ember what is a route's job (please list three)?

```sh
Routes handle transitions between various states of the app. They can:
- Conditionally redirect to a new URL;
- Update a controller so that it represents a particular model; and
- Change the or modify the on-screen template.
```
