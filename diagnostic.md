# Ember Diagnostic

What are three advantages of using Ember?

```sh
Ember separates concerns by having each piece of a web page have
a hbs file, a model, and a route. Ember makes creating a nav bar and
dropdown menus 10x easier with links. Ember also allows url routes
made 10x easier.
```

What is the templating system used in Ember? How it is related to
handlebars?

```sh
The template system is an hbs file that follows similar syntax as handlebars
like {{each}} methods and can also pull information out by using model.name etc
```

Name and describe at least two layers of an Ember application:

```sh
templates and routes. Templates are similar to handlebars. Routes can be used
to create new urls and links.
```

How does a component differ from an Ember template?

```sh
Ember will generate a component that consists of the ember template and a javascript file. The template will define how the component is rendered on the page and the javascript file defines how it will behave.
```

What is an opinionated framework? Is Ember opinionated? How or how not?

```sh
An opinionated framework has strict guidlines that users have to follow in order to use the framework. I think Ember is opinionated but for the better. A user could decide to make each file and connect the routes and etc. But Ember will also generate all of the files for you. You can use Ember to create routes and templates.
```

In Ember what is a route's job (please list three)?

```sh
Routes have 3 parts,
the mapping of the route to a URI, the javascript file that handles the routes behavior, and the route template that defines how the route is represented on the page.
```
