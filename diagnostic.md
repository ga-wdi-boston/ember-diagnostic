# Ember Diagnostic

What are three advantages of using Ember?

```sh
Components are modular. This means I have the ability to use them anywhere in my code even in different view states.
Ember is opinionated and structures file in a predictable and helpful manor.
Frameworks in general allow us to build smarter and more effecient apps.

```

What is the templating system used in Ember? How it is related to
handlebars?

```sh
The templating system in Ember is accessed throught the Ember CLI. When a new route is created with a route.js and a template.hbs file that corresponds with it. the handlebars template is what renders that routes viewstate
```

Name at least two layers of an Ember application (1.0 or 2.0):

```sh
# your answer here
```

How does a component differ from an Ember template?

```sh
Components are pieces of code that can be used anywhere in your code. Unlike the ember template, which I believe is only accessible via its route.
```

What is an opinionated framework? Is Ember opinionated? How or how not?

```sh
An opinionated framework makes assumptions about how your code is expected to be structured. Ember is opinionated in the way that the files are structured, but still allows flexibilty in the code. Where as Rails is MORE opinionated and straying from the regular stucture is more difficult.
```

In Ember what is a route's job (please list three)?

```sh
1. it renders a template
2. it can load the model to the corresponding template
3. it can handle action that involve chaning the model
```
