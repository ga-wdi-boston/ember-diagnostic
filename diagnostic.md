# Ember Diagnostic

What are three advantages of using Ember?

```sh
1. It provides data binding which is sikk.
2. It allows a user of your website to use their back/forward buttons and for a SPA to have a history.
3. It has tools to quickly generate the models, routes, templates, and other things you need.
```

What is the templating system used in Ember? How it is related to
handlebars?

```sh
The templating system used in Ember is an extended Handlebars. So all the
templates are written just like you would in Handlebars, but with Ember there
is tons of added functionality to make use of.
```

Name at least two layers of an Ember application (1.0 or 2.0):

```sh
There is the Route layer and then a Template layer.
```

How does a component differ from an Ember template?

```sh
A component is typically meant to be reused. It provides functionality that
any number of Ember templates can make use of.
```

What is an opinionated framework? Is Ember opinionated? How or how not?

```sh
An opinionated framework is one that requires you to do things ITS way. Ember
is very opinionated. It requires very specific naming conventions for things
like files and it follows "convention over configuration" strongly. It also
requires you to use the system it has put in place, rather than trying to make
some other kind of framework out of the pieces Ember provides (React is a lot
less opinionated in this manner, for example.)
```

In Ember what is a route's job (please list three)?

```sh
1. Parse an URL request from the server.
2. Map that URL to one or more route handlers.
3. The route handler than performs it's action, such as loading a template or model hook.
```
