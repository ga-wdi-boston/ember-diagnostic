# Ember Diagnostic

What are three advantages of using Ember?

```sh
routability, less AJAX, responsiveness
```

What is the templating system used in Ember? How it is related to
handlebars?

```sh
It IS handlebars! Pretty much. It also uses routes and components, but it's basically handlebars
```

Name and describe at least two layers of an Ember application:

```sh
Router, template, model, component
```

How does a component differ from an Ember template?

```sh
a component can be reused in other areas of your application, whereas templates only are used within a particular pod
```

What is an opinionated framework? Is Ember opinionated? How or how not?

```sh
An opinionated framework won't work (well) unless everything is written (especially names) according to its expectations. Ember is very opinionated. files need to have particular names and be located at a particular place inside a particular file structure. If you don't do that right, it won't work.
```

In Ember what is a route's job (please list three)?

```sh
parse the url
link to a component or template
load the UI via a model
```
