What are three advantages of using Ember?

```sh
One advantage of using Ember is it guides the devloper to build a webpage using
a convention over configuration approach. Also the way Ember uses routes allows
client to use the back button and revisit URLs in a way that wasnt possible using
our old way of building webpages. A third advantage of using ember is its way of
separating our concerns for us by separating our code into modules.
