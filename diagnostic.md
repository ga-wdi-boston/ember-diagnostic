# Ember Diagnostic

What are three advantages of using Ember?

```sh
Ember is highly opinionated so it minimizes the amount of time spent deciding on basic application architecture.

Ember allows developers to make their view states highly modular, which makes coding more organized.

Ember allows data to be more easily fetched and displayed to the UI.
```

What is the templating system used in Ember? How it is related to
handlebars?

```sh
The templates build DOM elements for each URL.  These are like handlebars except they are used to build the entire display to the user.
```

Name at least two layers of an Ember application (1.0 or 2.0):

```sh
The model layer and the view layer.
```

How does a component differ from an Ember template?

```sh
The components consist of templates that can be used to add to other templates with application-specific html tags.
```

What is an opinionated framework? Is Ember opinionated? How or how not?

```sh
An opinionated framework limits the number of architecture options available to the developer.  Ideally, the goal of this is to make application designing easier and more robust.  Ember is highly opinionated because it requires you to follow specific modular demands and structures.  The goal of this is a highly scalable application that can be continuously added to with mininial redesigning.
```

In Ember what is a route's job (please list three)?

```sh
1.  The routes job is to figure out what the user is looking at.
2.  The router then maps to the current URL, which will then go to a route handler and perform the correct action.
3.  The route selects and loads the correct model.

```
